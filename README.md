# Microsoft_Rewards

Microsoft Rewards is the program that lets you use your points for exchange for whatever they offer (gift cards, donations to organisations, Xbox, Microsoft surface etc.).
Basically, it's indirect money that you can only use in specific situations.
You can earn those points by "Binging" (like "Googling", but on Bing).

So, I made a Selenium script that searches 33 random words on Bing, so you can gather the maximum amount of points each day.
