# Microsoft Rewards

[Microsoft Rewards](https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/?refd=www.microsoft.com) is the program that lets you use your points for exchange for whatever they offer (gift cards, donations to organisations, Xbox, Microsoft surface, etc.).

Basically, it's **indirect money** that you can **only use in specific situations**.

You can earn those points by *"Binging"* (like "Googling", but on Bing). There is a limit of 33 searches that you can make each day.

So, I made a **Selenium script** that searches 33 random words on Bing, so you can gather the maximum amount of points each day. Enjoy the easy points while you can ðŸ˜ƒ.

# How to use

1. First, you need to install the [Selenium IDE](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/selenium-ide/ajdpfmkffanmkhejnopjppegokpogffp) extension on Edge. Yes on Edge, you will not get points if you do it on Chrome ðŸ˜¢ or on any other browser.
2. You should see the Selenium icon on the upper right if the installation was successful.
